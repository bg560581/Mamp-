    For example, before I added the white padding around each div everything was in the center of the screen but once I add the size and color it all moves over to the left side. -->

        <p class="trip-rome">Our second trip was to Rome. We took a train to Rome and spent the day visiting all the different tourist sites. We went to the vatican, the collussium, and finally The Trevi Fountain.</p>
        <div class="rome rome_pic1">
            <img src="images/7.JPG" alt="Rome">
            <p>Once we got off the train we walked a blck or two and got to Spanish Steps. We stayed at a hotel at the top of the Steps and set out to tour Rome </p>
        </div>
        <div class="rome rome_pic2">
            <img src="images/5.JPG" alt="Rome">
            <p>The first place went to in Rome was Vatican City. My parents set up a private tour of the city and we spent about 3-4 hours viewing all of Vatican City. This Picture was taken from a porch like area connected to the Vatican.</p>

            </video>
            <p>The last place that went through was the Sistine Chapel. We weren't supposed to take pictures or anything but I was able to sneak in a quick video of the ceiling. Something that I found to be very interesting about the chapel is the detail in the ceiling as you go from the back of the chapel to the front. The pictures not only get bigger but have much less detail when oyu get to the front. </p>

        <div class="rome rome_pic4">
            <img src="images/6.JPG" alt="Rome">
            <p>After leaving Vatican City we went to a cafe right outside of the city. From there we decided to tackle a few more places before calling it a day and one of those places was the Collussium. Unfortunatelly we weren't able to get a tour but we were able to take a pretty epic picture just outside.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="rome rome_pic5">
            <img src="images/8.JPG" alt="Rome">
            <p>We went passed the Collusium and walked down a path hoping to catch a view of the ancient ruins but we were kicked out. My brother Thomas took this picture as we were walking away from the ruins. </p>
        </div>
    </div>
        
    <div>
        <p>once leaving Rome we set out to the town where Padre Pio's shrine is. It took us a while to get there so we had to stay over at a nearby town and visit it tomorrow. We were able to catch some pretty awesome pictures along the way and catch some nice sites as the sun set.</p>

                <p class="nova_par">Since everyone in my family is villanova related we HAD to make a quick stop at the town of Villanova. The nicest place of the town was the sign. We had to take these two pictures for obvious reasons.</p>

            <p>When we finally got to Padre Pio's church everything was closed we were only able to get some beautiful pictures of the church from the outside as the sun started to go down. This is one of those pictures.</p>

            <img src="images/26.JPG" alt="Mountain Side">
            <p>After stopping at Padre Pio's we set out to find a place to eat. This picture is a from a resturaunt in a town on the side of a mountain. As the six of us piled out of a giant van we immediately caught the attention of the villagers. I could tell were not very welcomed from the looks we got... No one spoke a word of English in the entire town. </p>

                <img src="images/11.JPG" alt="Mountain Side Hotel">
                <p>Because we couldn't catch all we wanted to see in one day we had to find a place to stay for the night and get up early the next day to finish our site seeing. This picture is a view from the hotel we stayed at. The hotel was located in a small town on the top of a mountain over-looking the Adriatic sea.</p>

            <p>Around 7-8 we were on the road back to Padre Pio. Finally we were able to get into Pio's Shrine. This Photograph shows his shrine as well as his tomb. The walls and the ceiling are covered with a beautiful pattern of gold mosaic </p>

        <div class="forte_di_marmi">
            <p>after returning to Florence we settled down for a little bit. After a few days, we were heading out on our next jouney. We packed our bags and caught a train to Forte di Marmi. We spent the next 4-5 days here.</p>

                </video>
                <p>This video was taken the first night in Forte Di Marmi. We went to the top of our hotel and watched the sun as it sank into the Mediterranean Sea. This video shows how Forte Di Marmi is in between in sea and the mountains </p>

                <p>I had to add this photograph because it is one of the best pictures of the four sibolings that was taken this entire trip. We took the picture from the top of the hotel we stayed at in Forte Di Marmi as the sun set in front of us. </p>

                <p>This is one of my favorite pictures and although it doesnt really add much to the story of my trip I had to add it. This is view that we looked at from the top of the hotel.</p>

            <p>Our last  trip that we took was to Venice. We took a day trip to Venice and saw a lot of beautiful sites whether walking or on a gondola.</p>
            <div class="venice">
                <img src="images/22.JPG" alt="Venice">
                <p>The first thing we saw went we got to Venice was a church decorated in beautiful mosaic designs. Gold Mosaics cover the entire ceiling of the church.</p>

            <div class="venice">
                <img src="images/23.JPG" alt="Venice">
                <p>After walking through the church we were able to go to the top of the church where we were led out onto a balcony. From the balcony you could see a piazza as well as giant walkway that led to the waterfront, like shown in the photograph.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="venice">
                <img src="images/15.JPG" alt="Venice">
                <p>The family split up and I went with my brother. We were able to cover a lot more ground then if we just went as an entire family. In this photographer we are posing wearing the fedoras we bought along the way. behind us is one of the most popular bridges in Venice, The Rialto Bridge.  </p>

                    <p>These two images were taken from the gondala ride we took. As our day trip came to a close we had to take a gondola ride or it just wouldnt be the same. The first one was of the four sibolings on the gondola and the second is of the entire family after we finished the tour.</p>
