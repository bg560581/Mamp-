    For example, before I added the white padding around each div everything was in the center of the screen but once I add the size and color it all moves over to the left side. -->

            <p>The first place went to in Rome was Vatican City. My parents set up a private tour of the city and we spent about 3-4 hours viewing all of Vatican City. This Picture was taken from a porch like area connected to the Vatican.</p>

            <p>The last place that went through was the Sistine Chapel. We weren't supposed to take pictures or anything but I was able to sneak in a quick video of the ceiling. Something that I found to be very interesting about the chapel is the detail in the ceiling as you go from the back of the chapel to the front. The pictures not only get bigger but have much less detail when oyu get to the front. </p>

            <p>After leaving Vatican City we went to a cafe right outside of the city. From there we decided to tackle a few more places before calling it a day and one of those places was the Collussium. Unfortunatelly we weren't able to get a tour but we were able to take a pretty epic picture just outside.</p>

        <h4>once leaving Rome we set out to the town where Padre Pio's shrine is. It took us a while to get there so we had to stay over at a nearby town and visit it tomorrow.
